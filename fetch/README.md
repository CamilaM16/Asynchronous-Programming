# FOR, FOREACH, REDUCE, MAP
How `for`, `forEach`, `map`, and `reduce` work in JavaScript, along with their main differences, presented in a table:

| Method | Purpose | How it works | Main Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| for | General-purpose loop | Iterates through an array manually using a loop. | Requires explicit iteration and control. |
| forEach | Iteration with side effect | Iterates through an array, applying a function to each element. | Primarily used for iteration and applying functions, no return value. |
| map | Transformation | Iterates through an array, applying a function to each element and returning a new array with the results. | Returns a new array, leaving the original array unchanged. |
| reduce | Aggregation | Iterates through an array, accumulating a single value based on the elements. | Reduces an array to a single value (e.g., sum, product) and returns it. |
